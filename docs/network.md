# Network hub

This hub links the core docs for how OpenClaw connects, pairs, and secures
devices across localhost, LAN, and tailnet.

## Core model

- [Gateway architecture](/concepts/architecture)
- [Gateway protocol](/gateway/protocol)
- [Gateway runbook](/gateway)
- [Web surfaces + bind modes](/web)

## Pairing + identity

- [Pairing overview (DM + nodes)](/channels/pairing)
- [Gateway-owned node pairing](/gateway/pairing)
- [Devices CLI (pairing + token rotation)](/cli/devices)
- [Pairing CLI (DM approvals)](/cli/pairing)

Local trust:

- Local connections (loopback or the gateway host’s own tailnet address) can be
  auto‑approved for pairing to keep same‑host UX smooth.
- Non‑local tailnet/LAN clients still require explicit pairing approval.

## Discovery + transports

- [Discovery & transports](/gateway/discovery)
- [Bonjour / mDNS](/gateway/bonjour)
- [Remote access (SSH)](/gateway/remote)
- [Tailscale](/gateway/tailscale)

## Nodes + transports

- [Nodes overview](/nodes)
- [Bridge protocol (legacy nodes)](/gateway/bridge-protocol)
- [Node runbook: iOS](/platforms/ios)
- [Node runbook: Android](/platforms/android)

## Security

- [Security overview](/gateway/security)
- [Gateway config reference](/gateway/configuration)
- [Troubleshooting](/gateway/troubleshooting)
- [Doctor](/gateway/doctor)
